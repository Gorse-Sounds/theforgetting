## The Ideas

Everything here started as concepts, outlines, and frameworks I developed through years of thinking about music, embodiment, and what we lose when we reduce complex phenomena to their most measurable components. The themes, arguments, and directions are mine.

## The Execution

I'm using AI tools (Claude) to help articulate these ideas in written form. I'm confident in my ideation but less confident in my writing skills. Rather than let that gap prevent these ideas from existing in the world, I'm being transparent about the collaboration.

Think of it like this: I'm the architect providing detailed blueprints, specifications, and intent. The AI is the contractor executing the build. The structure, purpose, and design are mine. The actual construction gets help.

## Why This Matters

This project explores what gets lost when we strip embodied, contextual experience down to abstract patterns - particularly in music, but with broader implications for how we think about AI and human experience.

There's an irony in using AI to articulate ideas about AI's limitations. But that irony is productive. The tool is good at pattern manipulation and language generation. It's demonstrating its capabilities while I use those capabilities to examine what it can't do.

The ideas about haptic music, neural synchronization, context-dependent meaning, embodied rhythm - those come from me. The paragraphs that explain them clearly come from human-AI collaboration.

I'm not hiding the process because the process is part of the point.

## The Experiment

This is also a Substack publishing experiment. I'm testing whether I can develop and refine ideas in this format before potentially moving them to a newsletter platform. The Hugo setup lets me preview how these articles will read in a browser before committing to public publication.

If you find these ideas interesting, that's the part I'm responsible for. If you find the writing clear and engaging, credit the collaboration. If you find gaps in logic or weak arguments, that's on me - the AI can articulate but it can't fix flawed thinking.

## Contact

This is an evolving project. The ideas will develop, the execution will improve, and the relationship between human ideation and AI articulation will shift as I learn what this collaboration can and can't do.

For now, I'm focused on getting these ideas into readable form and seeing if they resonate with anyone besides me.
