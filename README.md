# The Forgetting - Substack Plan

## Core Concept
Exploring how music works as embodied, contextual experience - with AI/tech as recurring character showing us what's missing when you strip that away.

## Key Themes
- Music as multimodal experience (auditory, haptic, motor, emotional, social, temporal)
- How context (personal history, life story) shapes interpretation of abstract patterns
- How music connects people despite different individual contexts
- What gets forgotten when you remove the human listener

## Article Ideas

### 1. "Why You Feel Bass in Your Chest"
- Haptic dimension of music
- Julie Freeman's project Sonaforms® at shapedsound.com
- Bone conduction and Evelyn Glennie
- How low frequencies are felt proprioceptively, not just heard
- Why clubs are loud - music as full-body experience
- What the cochlea captures vs what your ribcage resonating does

### 2. "Your Body Knows the Beat Before You Do"
- Motor response to rhythm
- Why it's nearly impossible not to move to certain patterns
- Cerebellum, motor cortex, rhythm prediction below conscious awareness
- Why drummers lock into each other's timing
- What "groove" actually means neurologically

### 3. "The Chord That Makes You Cry (But Only Sometimes)"
- Same progression, different emotional response depending on context
- Why certain music hits you at 15 but not 40, or vice versa
- How accumulated experience shapes interpretation
- Role of memory, association, personal history in emotional response to abstract patterns

### 4. "Furniture That Sings"
- Deep dive on Julie Freeman's Sonaforms® work
- How making music haptic changes the listening experience
- What deaf people hear through bone conduction
- Sensory substitution
- Music as vibration pattern, not just acoustic signal

### 5. "What Happens When We Listen Together"
- Collective emotional states
- Why concerts work
- Neural synchronisation between listeners
- How shared listening creates connection despite different contexts
- The commons of feeling despite individual differences

### 6. "The Deceptive Cadence (Or: How to Manipulate Emotions with Math)"
- Compositional techniques that reliably generate emotional responses
- Why V-I resolution feels like coming home
- How composers exploit expectation and surprise
- The mathematics of tension and release

### 7. "Music Remembers What You've Forgotten"
- Why certain songs trigger vivid memories
- Neuroscience of music and autobiographical memory
- How a specific piece can transport you back to a moment
- Context flooding back through pattern recognition

## The AI Angle
- Not the main event - backdrop that shows what's essential by its absence
- "Here's what a system without a body, without memory, without emotion misses about music"
- Current AI can classify genres, generate compositions, but has no context, history, or emotional substrate
- Demonstrates the gap between pattern and meaning

## Starting Points
- Begin with either the haptic furniture piece (interview Julie Freeman) or the personal context piece (mine your own experience)
- Write what excites you most
- Get one published, see how it feels, adjust from there

## Why This Works
- Stems from things you actually care about (passion sustains a Substack)
- Love letters to musical experience, not AI critiques
- Sustainable weekly writing vs forcing contrarian takes
- Multiple dimensions to explore: neuroscience, physics, personal stories, compositional techniques, technology, collective listening
